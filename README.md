# Baria FinGuard Wallet

**Baria: Decentralized Collective Intelligence**

This project presents a decentralized finance (DeFi) wallet interface concept, focusing on community governance, treasury management, and various investment strategies.  It leverages Web3 technologies for enhanced user control and security.

## Features

**Wallet Interaction:**

* **Web3 Login:**  Provides complete independency, non-custodial ownership, private communication, and the best user experience. Connects to user's Web3 wallet.
* **Web2 Login:** Offers limited functionality without asset ownership and relies on centralized platforms.

**Collective Intelligence:**

* **DAO Treasury Management:** Enables a Treasury Committee to manage organizational funds.
* **Dashboard & Vaults:** Provides insights into various market indicators and vault performance, including:
    * Halving BullBear
    * Fear and Greed Index
    * Crash Fishing Perp
    * High Risk/Reward Index
    * Onchain Data Dashboard
    * Vault statistics (TVL, APR, Age)
    * 7-day performance graph
    * Deposit and withdrawal functionality

**Vaults:**

Vaults function like liquidity pools, allowing DAOs, institutions, and individuals to deposit funds and earn returns. Vault managers use these funds for trading perpetual contracts (Perps), distributing profits and losses proportionally among depositors. Vault owners receive 10% of the profits (customizable). Management can be manual or automated. Users should carefully assess risk and historical performance before depositing.
