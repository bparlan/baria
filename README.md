## Features

**Vaults:**

Vaults function like liquidity pools, allowing DAOs, institutions, and individuals to deposit funds and earn returns. Vault managers use these funds for trading perpetual contracts (Perps), distributing profits and losses proportionally among depositors. Vault owners receive 10% of the profits (customizable). Management can be manual or automated. Users should carefully assess risk and historical performance before depositing.
